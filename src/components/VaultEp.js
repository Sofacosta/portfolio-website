        Vault starts with an hypnotic acid drone piece with “Bones”, a one-take live recording of several different synths, followed by “Time is Not Linear”, an exploration of loops created by the evocative sound of modular synthesizers. “Cornelius” plays with textures, samples and noise. The EP ends with the title track “Vault”, which layers live acid sounds on top of the drums.</p>
