        COUNTERCLOCKWISE includes samples of beats, field recordings,
        vocalizations, and instrumentations from an exciting selection of
        musicians, poets and artists. The samples on COUNTERCLOCKWISE are open
        source, so you can use them however you want. That said, itâ€™s cool to
        give the artists credit, and if money is involved, fair payment.
        COUNTERCLOCKWISE was created as a companion sample tape to be used with
        the HC-TT.{' '}
