    htmlDescription: '<p class="justify-center">Vault starts with an hypnotic acid drone piece with “Bones”, a one-take live recording of several different synths, followed by “Time is Not Linear”, an exploration of loops created by the evocative sound of modular synthesizers. “Cornelius” plays with textures, samples and noise. The EP ends with the title track “Vault”, which layers live acid sounds on top of the drums.</p><br><hr><p class="mx-auto justify-center py-4">Vault EP was released on January 26, 2021 receiving very positive feedback from different outlets:<ul><li><a href=https://ra.co/exchange/556 rel=noreferrer target=_blank>Resident advisor</a><li><a href=https://filtermexico.com/2021/01/27/coast2c-explora-el-minimalismo-del-drone-y-el-techno-en-vault/ rel=noreferrer target=_blank>Filter Mexico</a><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REBfhwf9UHk"rel=noreferrer target=_blank>Hate Lab</a><li><a href=https://coldexperiment.com/news/coast2c-vault/ rel=noreferrer target=_blank>Cold Experiment</a><li><a href=https://www.techclubbers.com/coast2c-vaul-ep-gestef-records/ rel=noreferrer target=_blank>Tech Clubbers</a><li><a href=http://wickedstyle.neural.it/2020/12/coast2c-vault/ rel=noreferrer target=_blank>Wicked Style</a><li><a href=https://soundcloud.com/thebrvtalistxx/coast2c-time-is-not-linear-gestef-records rel=noreferrer target=_blank>The Brvtalist</a></ul>',
