      'This is a sketch made in Processing with original music. The sketch represents a group of ideas from movies, essays, podcasts and music that I have encountered regarding feminism, technology, gender and identity.   • The text is from one of the opening phrases from Donna Haraway’s essay: The Cyborg Manifesto.   “A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. Social reality is lived social relations, our most important political construction, a world-changing fiction”.  • The cyborg animation is a clip from artist Marco De Archangelis’ video Making of Cyborg – Making of Shell. This clip depicts the Artist’s interpretation of the opening scene of Ghost in the Shell by Kōkaku Kidōtai.   Source Youtube: Daz3D – Making of Cyborg – Making of Shell   • All sound is created with modular synthesizers. The spoken words are a sample from the XX Files Radio podcast: Made in Residence.
