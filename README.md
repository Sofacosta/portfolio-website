## Notes 
### September 3rd, 2021
- I decided to build the project on React and use Mailchimp as a marketing tool to manage email subscriptions. At the moment I want to incorporate something functional and spend time on working with UI.
- I am using [https://tailwindcss.com/]() for my css framework as I want to make this website responsive.
### September 8, 2021
- I looked at documentation and installed Tailwind into project.
- I added Mailchimp's form embeded code for Newslettter. 
### September 10, 2021
- I spent some time looking at different websites to have an idea on how to design mine. The focus is to be professional,creative and engaging. 
- I made a list of all the content I currently have to have a better idea on where to place it.
