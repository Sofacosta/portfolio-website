## Description
It will include the following views: projects (media), events, blog, about, sign-up form, news, VAULT EP and contact. 

MVP: 
- A functional sign up form so users can submit their email to recieve occasional news. 
- Some sort of UI so users can navigate through content
- Connect database to a newsletter marketing tool 

## Notes September 3rd, 2021
- I decided to build the project on React and use Mailchimp as a marketing tool to manage email subscriptions. At the moment I want to incorporate something functional and spend time on working with UI
- I am using [https://tailwindcss.com/]() for my css framework as I want to make this website responsive.
